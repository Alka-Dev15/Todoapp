# Todoapp
This is a simple Todo application built using React. It allows users to create and manage todo notes. The app utilizes React hooks, specifically useState for managing the state of todos and useEffect for saving the todo data to the browser's local storage. This ensures that the todos persist even after the page is refreshed or closed.
